The INTERTWinE project is committed to helping application developers to write
scalable code that can run on the world's largest supercomputers, by employing
combinations of existing programming models (so called hybridisation) in a way
that future-proofs the development work for the next generation of HPC systems.

This preliminary Resource Pack helps developers create efficient and effective,
scalable applications improving the resource utilization of the system but also
facilitating the use of multiple parallel libraries within the same application.

Other programming model/ API combinations are addressed in other resource packs
available from the INTERTWinE Developer Hub
(http://www.intertwine-project.eu/developer-hub).

Instructions to build and execute the codes are available in the applications/
kernels folders.
