About:
======

The code included in this package solves LU Factorizations of Hierarchical Matrices (including dense and null blocks).
The code has been tested with OpenMP and GCC compiler.

Building the library:
=====================

1. Link correctly GCC and MKL sequential library editing the "Makefile" file.

2. Load OmpSs and MKL modules (if necessary).

2. Build the project by running
    make

Running the tests:
==================

3. Run the tests by
    cd tests
    ./Execute.sh

Remark 1: Two small Hierarchical Matrices are provided (in "H-Matrices" folder) to run the tests.
Remark 2: Tests results are stored in the file "Tests_results.txt inside" "tests" folder.
