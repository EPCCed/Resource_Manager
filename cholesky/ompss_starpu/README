About:
======

The code included in this package solves the Cholesky decomposition by
distributing the matrix blocks to OmpSs tasks. These blocks are then further
split in subblocks, that are run on StarPU tasks.

The code has been tested with GNU C compiler.

Building the library:
=====================

1. Edit the top lines of the Makefile to fit your environment

2. Build by running
    make

Running the tests:
==================

3. Run the tests by
    make check

Comments:
=========
 - Please use Nanos 6 in resource-manager branch, and Mercurium in commit 5aa4b46
 - To enable result checking, define "CHECK_RESULT" on main.c
 - With the current version of DDSs, it is not possible to check the correct
   result of the test. This is because StarPU works with column-major, whereas
   DDSs works with row-major.
 - The flag "LASs_WITH_CHAMELEON" from the Makefile enables tasks to be sent to
   StarPU. If this flag is removed, the example will run only with OmpSs tasks.
