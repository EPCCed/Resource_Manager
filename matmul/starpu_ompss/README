About:
======

The code included in this package solves the matrix multiplication problem by
distributing the matrix blocks to StarPU tasks. These blocks are then further
split in subblocks, that are run on OmpSs tasks.

The code has been tested with GNU C compiler.

Building the library:
=====================

1. Edit the top lines of the Makefile to fit your environment

2. Build by running
    make

Running the tests:
==================

3. Run the tests by
    make check

Comments:
=========
 - Please use Nanos 6 in resource-manager branch, and Mercurium in commit 5aa4b46
 - To enable result checking, define "CHECK_RESULT" on main.c
 - With the current version of DDSs, it is not possible to check the correct
   result of the test. This is because StarPU works with column-major, whereas
   DDSs works with row-major.
 - Other versions can be compiled by changing "INTEROP_KERNEL" on
   starpu_dgemm.c. "BLAS" version runs the StarPU blocks using MKL. "OMPSS"
   runs the StarPU blocks using OmpSs-2 native interface. "OPENCL", the
   default, runs the StarPU blocks using OmpSs-2 called from OpenCL.
